# Movie Recommender

### Overview
This project gives movie recommendations to users who are not sure what they want to watch. It has a random movie generator that randomly displays one movie from our database. We also have movies listed by genre so our user has more control on the type of movie they would like. The movies are displayed after clicking on the genre from the dropdown button "movies by genre"
